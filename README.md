Minimal audio synthesis on iOS

The goal is to provide an absolutely minimal framework, written entirely in Swift, using Audio Units, into which an audio sample renderer could be dropped. In theory, with a little work, it ought to be possible to use [Moodler](https://github.com/dpiponi/Moodler) to synthesise an audio synthesiser and drop it into this project.
